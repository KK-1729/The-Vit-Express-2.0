### Team Formation:
A part of the graded work throughout the course will be done in four persons per team. You get to pick your own partners.

1. Pick the name for your team. 

<hr> 

#### Pick a Topic:
Pick a web application project on your interest. Investigate and analyse the project and come up with new ideas. The team will submit a Review on the investigations. To find a topic that interests you, I suggest looking at the topics on current trends.
 
The project must contain the following
•	Must use Apache server, MySQL and PHP script. 
•	Choose the team leader, DB creator, Scriptwriter, Web Page Designer, etc. This helps you to do the project in a good manner. 
•	The project should contain a minimum of 3 forms. Use necessary conditions for form fields validation where ever it is applicable. 
•	Besides, your free to make use of any web frameworks for this project, its optional.

You must do a literature search and identify a bunch of research work in the chosen topic area. You will analyze these existing works and present your analyses to me. Based on your presentation, I may require you to change the scope or direction of your investigation. 

This should happen before March 10th, 2021.


#### Team Reports:
Each team will report its progress regularly. Each team will give progress reports during the course. For all deliverables, the team must submit/upload a final report before the presentation. 
It is mandatory to keep your project updates (source code and review documentation) in the GitHub repository provided by the faculty.

One file per team is sufficient mentioning the team members.

### Plagiarism:
Each team presentation and the team deliverables must be entirely your teams own. No plagiarism. If in my judgment any team presentation or the team deliverables is not entirely your teams own work and submitted or copied from somewhere else, you will automatically receive, as a minimum, a grade of zero for the assignment.
